        There's gotta be another way out
        I've been stuck in a cage with my doubt
        I've tried forever getting out on my own
        But every time I do this my way
        I get caught in the lies of the enemy
        I lay my troubles down
      
        Break me out
    

        Break me out

        Come and find me in the dark now
        Every day by myself I'm breaking down
       
        I don't wanna fight alone anymore
        Break me out
        From the prison of my own pride
        My God, I need a hope I can't deny
        In the end I'm realizing
        I was never meant to fight on my own
        Every little thing that I've known
        
        Is every thing I need to let go
        You're so much bigger than the world I have made
        So I surrender my soul
        I'm reaching out for your hope
        I lay my weapons down
      
        I'm ready for you now
        Break me out
        Come and find me in the dark now
        Every day by myself I'm breaking down
        I don't wanna fight alone anymore
        Break me out
      
        From the prison of my own pride
        My God, I need a hope I can't deny
        In the end I'm realizing
        I was never meant to fight on my own
        I don't wanna be incomplete
        I remember what you said to me
        I don't have to fight alone
        Break me out
      
        Come and find me in the dark now
        Every day by myself I'm breaking down
        I don't wanna fight alone anymore
        Break me out
        From the prison of my own pride
        My God, I need a hope I can't deny
        In the end I'm realizing
        I was never meant to fight on my own
